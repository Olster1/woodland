#Woodland Editor

Aimed to be a text editor that:
1. Loads Instantly on startup

2. Load and edit big files just as easily as small files

3. A single exe file

4. Stable - doesn't crash

5. A cross between Sublime Text and 4Coder

It's really just for me as a fun project, something to practice using Direct3d and practice getting better at programming :)
